Welcome to the official AskSteem API Documentation! In this README you can find some basic steps for getting started, however, for full documentation visit our [wiki](https://github.com/Hoxly/asksteem-docs/wiki)

# Getting Started
Using the AskSteem Search API for basic queries is super simple. 

## Search Endpoint
The search endpoint is located at `https://api.asksteem.com/search` and has one required parameter called `q` which should be passed a keyword or phrase to search for.

For example:
`https://api.asksteem.com/search?q=steem` will search the AskSteem index for posts related to the keyword "steem" and return the results as JSON which can be easily parsed by most programming languages. 

Here is a sample response:
```json
{
	"pages": {
		"current": 1,
		"has_previous": false,
		"has_next": true
	},
	"error": false,
	"hits": 325,
	"results": [{

```

The `search` endpoint also accepts a `pg` parameter to select the page of results to return. By if not provided the page will default to 1 and for any given query there is a max of 10 pages that can be returned. 

For example:
`https://api.asksteem.com/search?q=asksteem&pg=2` would return the second page of results for the term "asksteem".

Some other parameters for the search endpoint are:
* `include` - to include additional fields for each search result
* `sort_by` - to sort the search results by a specific field
* `order` - used in combination with `sort_by` to determine how the specified field should be sorted (`asc` or `desc`)
* `types` - used to specify the types of content to be included in results (`user` and/or `post`)
